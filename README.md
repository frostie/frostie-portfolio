# frostie-portfolio
I'm working on a portfolio web template that will showcase all of my music and front-end dev projects. Check out the prototype:

## Style
- Single-page website
- Simple theme with thumbnails to showcase projects; broken into music and dev sections
- An 'About' section to briefly outline career and educational background
- A 'Contact' form

## DevLog
- Oct 16: Added smooth scrolling to nav links with jQuery
- Oct 17: Added back-to-top button
- Oct 21: Started concept 2 of the portfolio website
- Oct 25: Centered project thumbnails

## Issues
- JavaScript smooth scrolling doesn't work on mobile (iOS)
- Back-to-top button's fixed positioning isn't working on mobile (iOS)

## Next Actions
- Add projects to site
- Add info to each thumbnail when hovering over
- Refactor code
