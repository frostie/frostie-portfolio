# frostie-portfolio
I'm working on a portfolio web template that will showcase all of my music and front-end dev projects. Check out the prototype: https://codepen.io/frostie-dev/pen/qBWvwVb

## Style
- Single-page website
- Simple theme with thumbnails to showcase projects; broken into music and dev sections
- An 'About' section to briefly outline career and educational background
- A 'Contact' form

## DevLog
- Oct 16: Added smooth scrolling with jQuery
- Oct 17: Added back-to-top button

## Issues
- JavaScript smooth scrolling doesn't work on mobile (iOS)
- Back-to-top button's fixed positioning isn't working on mobile (iOS)
- Page isn't centered on certain screen sizes

## Next Actions
- Add smooth scrolling to back-to-top button
- Add projects to site

## A Closer Look
